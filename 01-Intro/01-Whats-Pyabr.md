### Programmers
I`m Mani Jamali, I love Python programming language and it's my favorite programing language.
Pyabr is the best idea in my programing life created in July.
At first Pyabr had a small core for loading it apps.

***Get the first version of Pyabr:***

After developing the wet core I went to develop and start the Pyabr project on September.
